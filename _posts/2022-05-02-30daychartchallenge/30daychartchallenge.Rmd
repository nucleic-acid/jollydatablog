## The Challenge

The #30DayChartChallenge is a data visualization community project on Twitter, that was first initialized in 2021 and returned for a second instance in April 2022. The idea is simple: each day in April is given a certain motto or prompt. Participants contribute one data visualization for each day, that should somehow incorporate the given motto.

This year's prompts were as follows:

This year I managed to contribute 21 visualizations that I will post below. The code can be found at my [github repo](https://github.com/nucleic-acid/30DayChartChallenge_2022).
