      "contents": "\nWe are very delighted that you have shown interest in this blog. Data\nprotection is of a particularly high priority for the author of the\njolly data blog. The use of the Internet pages of the jolly data blog is\npossible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data\nsubject wants to use special enterprise services via our website,\nprocessing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of\npersonal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such\nprocessing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.\nThe processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail\naddress, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line\nwith the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance\nwith the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the\njolly data blog. By means of this data protection declaration, our\nenterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope,\nand purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.\nFurthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data\nprotection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.\nAs the controller, the jolly data blog has implemented numerous\ntechnical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete\nprotection of personal data processed through this website. However,\nInternet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps,\nso absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every\ndata subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative\nmeans, e.g. by telephone.\nDefinitions\nThe data protection declaration of the jolly data blog is based on\nthe terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection\ndeclaration should be legible and understandable for the general public,\nas well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would\nlike to first explain the terminology used.\nIn this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the\nfollowing terms:\nPersonal data\nPersonal data means any information relating to an identified or\nidentifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural\nperson is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in\nparticular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an\nidentification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or\nmore factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,\neconomic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\nData subject\nData subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose\npersonal data is processed by the controller responsible for the\nprocessing.\nProcessing\nProcessing is any operation or set of operations which is performed\non personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by\nautomated means, such as collection, recording, organisation,\nstructuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation,\nuse, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making\navailable, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or\ndestruction.\nRestriction of processing\nRestriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with\nthe aim of limiting their processing in the future.\nProfiling\nProfiling means any form of automated processing of personal data\nconsisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal\naspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or\npredict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work,\neconomic situation, health, personal preferences, interests,\nreliability, behaviour, location or movements.\nPseudonymisation\nPseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner\nthat the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data\nsubject without the use of additional information, provided that such\nadditional information is kept separately and is subject to technical\nand organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not\nattributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.\nController or controller responsible for the processing\nController or controller responsible for the processing is the\nnatural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which,\nalone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the\nprocessing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such\nprocessing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller\nor the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union\nor Member State law.\nProcessor\nProcessor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or\nother body which processes personal data on behalf of the\ncontroller.\nRecipient\nRecipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or\nanother body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third\nparty or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal\ndata in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union\nor Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing\nof those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with\nthe applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the\nprocessing.\nThird party\nThird party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or\nbody other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who,\nunder the direct authority of the controller or processor, are\nauthorised to process personal data.\nConsent\nConsent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed\nand unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or\nshe, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies\nagreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or\nher.\n\nName and Address of the controller\nController for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the\nEuropean Union and other provisions related to data protection is:\nChristian A.

Cookies are\ntext files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet\nbrowser.\nMany Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a\nso-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.\nIt consists of a character string through which Internet pages and\nservers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the\ncookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to\ndifferentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other\nInternet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet\nbrowser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.\nThrough the use of cookies, the jolly data blog can provide the users\nof this website with more user-friendly services that would not be\npossible without the cookie setting.\nBy means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can\nbe optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously\nmentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this\nrecognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The\nwebsite user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data\neach time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the\nwebsite, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer system.\nAnother example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The\nonline store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the\nvirtual shopping cart via a cookie.\nThe data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies\nthrough our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet\nbrowser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nFurthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an\nInternet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all\npopular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting\nof cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our\nwebsite may be entirely usable.\nCollection of general data and information\nThe website of the jolly data blog collects a series of general data\nand information when a data subject or automated system calls up the\nwebsite. This general data and information are stored in the server log\nfiles. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the\noperating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from\nwhich an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4)\nthe sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site,\n(6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service\nprovider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and\ninformation that may be used in the event of attacks on our information\ntechnology systems.\nWhen using these general data and information, the jolly data blog\ndoes not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this\ninformation is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website\ncorrectly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its\nadvertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information\ntechnology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law\nenforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal\nprosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the jolly data blog\nanalyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with\nthe aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our\nenterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the\npersonal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are\nstored separately from all personal data provided by a data\nsubject.\nComments function in the blog\nThe jolly data blog offers users the possibility to leave individual\ncomments on individual blog contributions\nIf a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this\nwebsite, the comments made by the data subject are also stored and\npublished, as well as information on the date of the commentary and on\nthe user’s (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject. In addition, the IP\naddress assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) to the data\nsubject is also logged. This storage of the IP address takes place for\nsecurity reasons, and in case the data subject violates the rights of\nthird parties, or posts illegal content through a given comment. The\nstorage of these personal data is, therefore, in the own interest of the\ndata controller, so that he can exculpate in the event of an\ninfringement. This collected personal data will not be passed to third\nparties, unless such a transfer is required by law or serves the aim of\nthe defense of the data controller.\nThe comments function is provided via a service called “utterances”.\nUtterances is a third party open\nsoruce software (“widget”) that can be implemented into websites. The\nsource code may be seen at https://github.com/utterance.\nUtterances provides the widget as an interface to read and write\ncomments on the jolly data blog, but the above mentioned data regarding\nthe comments function are stored on www.github.com by “GitHub, Inc.” and\nrequire a valid login to the github service. The comments left by the\ndata subject through the utterances widget on the jolly data blog are\nstored in the publicly accessible repository https://github.com/nucleic-acid/comments.jollydata.blog\nand by this are stored on server infrastructure not controlled by the\nowner of the jolly data blog. The comments left through the jolly data\nblog can also be seen in the https://github.com/nucleic-acid/comments.jollydata.blog\nrepository without the need to access the jolly data blog website.\nAs the utterances widget is loaded automatically from https://utteranc.es/client.js when accessing a blog\npost, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) to\nthe data subject may also be logged by the utterances service provider.\nFor the handling of data by GitHub Inc. please refer to the GitHub\nPrivacy Statement and to their Terms\nof Service.\nRoutine erasure and blocking of personal data\nThe data controller shall process and store the personal data of the\ndata subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of\nstorage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or\nother legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is\nsubject to.\nIf the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period\nprescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator\nexpires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance\nwith legal requirements.\nRights of the data subject\nRight of confirmation\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European\nlegislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether\nor not personal data concerning him or her are being processed.

Where this is the case, the\ndata subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate\nsafeguards relating to the transfer.\nIf a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he\nor she may, at any time, contact any employee of the\ncontroller.\nRight to rectification\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European\nlegislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the\nrectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking\ninto account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have\nthe right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means\nof providing a supplementary statement.\nIf a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he\nor she may, at any time, contact any employee of the\ncontroller.\nRight to erasure (Right to be forgotten)\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European\nlegislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data\nconcerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have\nthe obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of\nthe following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not\nnecessary:\nThe personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes\nfor which they were collected or otherwise processed. The data subject\nwithdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point\n(a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the\nGDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing. The\ndata subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the\nGDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing,\nor the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2)\nof the GDPR. The personal data have been unlawfully processed. The\npersonal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in\nUnion or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The\npersonal data have been collected in relation to the offer of\ninformation society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR. If\none of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to\nrequest the erasure of personal data stored by the jolly data blog, he\nor she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An\nemployee of jolly data blog shall promptly ensure that the erasure\nrequest is complied with immediately.\nWhere the controller has made personal data public and is obliged\npursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller,\ntaking account of available technology and the cost of implementation,\nshall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform\nother controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has\nrequested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or\nreplication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not\nrequired. An employees of the jolly data blog will arrange the necessary\nmeasures in individual cases.\nRight of restriction of processing\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European\nlegislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where\none of the following applies:\nThe accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject,\nfor a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the\npersonal data. The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes\nthe erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of\ntheir use instead. The controller no longer needs the personal data for\nthe purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data\nsubject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The\ndata subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the\nGDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the\ncontroller override those of the data subject. If one of the\naforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request\nthe restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the jolly\ndata blog, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the\ncontroller. The employee of the jolly data blog will arrange the\nrestriction of the processing.\nRight to data portability\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European\nlegislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which\nwas provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and\nmachine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit\nthose data to another controller without hindrance from the controller\nto which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing\nis based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or\npoint (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to\npoint (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out\nby automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the\nperformance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the\nexercise of official authority vested in the controller.\nFurthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability\npursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the\nright to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to\nanother, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely\naffect the rights and freedoms of others.\nIn order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject\nmay at any time contact any employee of the jolly data blog.\nRight to object\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European\nlegislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular\nsituation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or\nher, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.\nThis also applies to profiling based on these provisions.\nThe jolly data blog shall no longer process the personal data in the\nevent of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate\ngrounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and\nfreedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or\ndefence of legal claims.\nIf the jolly data blog processes personal data for direct marketing\npurposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to\nprocessing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing.\nThis applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such\ndirect marketing. If the data subject objects to the jolly data blog to\nthe processing for direct marketing purposes, the jolly data blog will\nno longer process the personal data for these purposes.\nIn addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to\nhis or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal\ndata concerning him or her by the jolly data blog for scientific or\nhistorical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to\nArticle 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the\nperformance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.\nIn order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may\ncontact any employee of the jolly data blog. In addition, the data\nsubject is free in the context of the use of information society\nservices, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her\nright to object by automated means using technical\nspecifications.\nAutomated individual decision-making, including profiling\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European\nlegislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated\nprocessing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning\nhim or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as\nthe decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the\nperformance of, a contract between the data subject and a data\ncontroller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to\nwhich the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable\nmeasures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and\nlegitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject’s explicit\nconsent.\nIf the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the\nperformance of, a contract between the data subject and a data\ncontroller, or (2) it is based on the data subject’s explicit consent,\nthe jolly data blog shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the\ndata subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least\nthe right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to\nexpress his or her point of view and contest the decision.\nIf the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning\nautomated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time,\ncontact any employee of the jolly data blog.\nRight to withdraw data protection consent\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European\nlegislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her\npersonal data at any time.\nIf the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the\nconsent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the jolly\ndata blog.\n\nData protection provisions about the application and use of\nTwitter\nOn this website, the controller has integrated components of Twitter.\nTwitter is a multilingual, publicly-accessible microblogging service on\nwhich users may publish and spread so-called ‘tweets,’ e.g. short\nmessages, which are limited to 280 characters. These short messages are\navailable for everyone, including those who are not logged on to\nTwitter. The tweets are also displayed to so-called followers of the\nrespective user. Followers are other Twitter users who follow a user’s\ntweets. Furthermore, Twitter allows you to address a wide audience via\nhashtags, links or retweets.\nThe operating company of Twitter is Twitter International Company,\nOne Cumberland Place, Fenian Street Dublin 2, D02 AX07, Ireland.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet\nsite, which is operated by the controller and on which a Twitter\ncomponent (Twitter button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the\ninformation technology system of the data subject is automatically\nprompted to download a display of the corresponding Twitter component of\nTwitter. Further information about the Twitter buttons is available\nunder https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons. During\nthe course of this technical procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what\nspecific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject. The\npurpose of the integration of the Twitter component is a retransmission\nof the contents of this website to allow our users to introduce this web\npage to the digital world and increase our visitor numbers.\nIf the data subject is logged in at the same time on Twitter, Twitter\ndetects with every call-up to our website by the data subject and for\nthe entire duration of their stay on our Internet site which specific\nsub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This\ninformation is collected through the Twitter component and associated\nwith the respective Twitter account of the data subject. If the data\nsubject clicks on one of the Twitter buttons integrated on our website,\nthen Twitter assigns this information to the personal Twitter user\naccount of the data subject and stores the personal data.\nTwitter receives information via the Twitter component that the data\nsubject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is\nlogged in on Twitter at the time of the call-up to our website. This\noccurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Twitter component\nor not. If such a transmission of information to Twitter is not\ndesirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by\nlogging off from their Twitter account before a call-up to our website\nis made.\nThe applicable data protection provisions of Twitter may be accessed\nunder https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en.\nLegal basis for the processing\nArt. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing\noperations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing\npurpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the\nperformance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the\ncase, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the\nsupply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based\non Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing\noperations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual\nmeasures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products\nor services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which\nprocessing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of\ntax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In\nrare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect\nthe vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nThis would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our\ncompany and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital\ninformation would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other\nthird party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d\nGDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not\ncovered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is\nnecessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our\ncompany or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden\nby the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject\nwhich require protection of personal data. Such processing operations\nare particularly permissible because they have been specifically\nmentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate\ninterest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the\ncontroller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\nThe legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third\nparty\nWhere the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f\nGDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of\nthe well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.\nPeriod for which the personal data will be stored\nThe criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data\nis the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that\nperiod, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no\nlonger necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation\nof a contract.\nProvision of personal data as statutory or contractual\nrequirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation\nof the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences\nof failure to provide such data\nWe clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by\nlaw (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual\nprovisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it\nmay be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides\nus with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The\ndata subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data\nwhen our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of\nthe personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the\ndata subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by\nthe data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The\nemployee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the\npersonal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the\nconclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide\nthe personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal\ndata.\nExistence of automated decision-making\nAs a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or\nprofiling.\nThis Privacy Policy has been generated by the Privacy Policy\nGenerator of the DGD - Your External DPO that was developed in\ncooperation with German Lawyers from WILDE BEUGER SOLMECKE, Cologne.\n\n\n\n",
