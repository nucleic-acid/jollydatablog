## `r fa("book")`  About
I'm a medical doctor specializing in human genetics. Apart from that, I'm interested in open and reproducible research, data analysis and data visualization. This is my personal blog, where I like to share my views on topics, I'm excited about: statistics, exploring open data and the intersection of science communication, data visualization and informative illustrations. I enjoy using Rmarkdown to create documents or reports, R and Python and dealing with layout and typography.

When I'm not counseling or diving into datasets, I love taking photos, reading popular scientific astronomy books, listening to science podcasts and music.
