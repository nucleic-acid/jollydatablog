# Welcome aboard the jolly data blog!

My name is Chris and I write about the exploration of open datasets, data visualization and other topics concerning `r fa(name = "r-project")` or `r fa(name = "python")`.

I want to share, what I learn, while I sail across the vast oceans of data. Check out the **blog** for the latest posts!

There are also collections of contributions to DataViz challenges and of other **projects** that might interest you.
